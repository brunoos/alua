Welcome to the 4.0 release of ALua.

In this new version, ALua has been completely rewritten in Lua. There's no more
code to be compiled. Just install the .lua files in src/ somewhere, adjust the
paths, and you should be done. However, apart from LuaSocket, there is now
another dependency: LuaPosix. Both libraries have proven to be extremely
portable, and should represent no harm in most environments.
