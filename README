Welcome to the 5.0 release of ALua.

To install,  just the  alua.lua file and  the directory _alua  to your
LUA_PATH.   However, apart  from  LuaSocket, there  are  now more  two
dependencies: LuaPosix and LuaTimer.   All libraries have proven to be
extremely portable, and should represent no harm in most environments.
