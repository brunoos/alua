 ALua 6.0
---------

ALua  is  developed almost  all  in Lua  language,  with  a small  and
platform  dependent C  part.  ALua  depends of  LuaSocket  package for
network  communication,  and provides  support  for  timers using  the
optional package LuaTimer (see below).

To install the Lua part
  * Copy the 'alua.lua' file and 'alua' directory, both in 'src'
    directory,  to some place in your LUA_PATH.

To install the C part
  (i) on Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X
    * Enter the 'unix' directory
    * Edit 'Makefile' accordingly
    * Use the 'make' command to build the library, as follows
      - make linux        , or
      - make bsd          , or
      - make macosx
    * Install the 'alua.so' library using the command 'make install' or
      copy manually the file to some place in your LUA_CPATH.

  (ii) on Windows
    You  can download  the ALua  package for  Windows from  the ALua's
    site, which already includes the Windows library.

    Or build the package yourself:
    * The directory 'windows' contain a Visual C++ project that builds 
      the 'alua.dll' library.
    * Copy this library to some place in you LUA_CPATH.
